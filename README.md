# RadianceModellingScattering
Python Code to model the radiance and scattering of light in a slab of material using the P3 approximation. 

We simulate the scattering and propagation of light in a medium of rectangular slab geometry. We use the 
radiative transfer equation to model the radiance using the P3 approximation for the modeeling of the solution of the equation.
